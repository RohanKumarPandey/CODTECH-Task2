Mentor: SRAVANI GOUNI


Overview:

The goal is to implement core data structures such as linked lists, trees, and graphs using C++. These data structures will be developed to handle standard operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching, providing a foundation for various algorithmic solutions and optimizations in competitive programming, software development, or systems design.

Key Activities:

1. Linked Lists:

Implement singly and doubly linked lists.

Support operations like insertion (at head, tail, and specific position), deletion, and traversal.



2. Trees:

Develop binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and possibly AVL or Red-Black trees.

Operations include insertion, deletion, and traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order).



3. Graphs:

Implement graph structures (adjacency list or matrix).

Provide support for operations like insertion (adding nodes/edges), deletion (removing nodes/edges), traversal (DFS, BFS), and searching for connections or paths.



4. Testing:

Test all data structures for correctness and performance.

Include edge cases like empty structures, single element operations, and invalid operations.




Technology Used:

Language: C++.

C++ STL: Optionally, STL containers like vector, list, or queue can be utilized in some cases, especially for graph and tree traversals.


Objective:

The main objective is to gain a deeper understanding of fundamental data structures by implementing them from scratch. This enhances problem-solving skills, improves algorithmic thinking, and helps in mastering concepts needed for competitive programming, coding interviews, or software development.
